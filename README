Validation

This is just another jQuery validation plugin, positive points are:

    * Easy to use.
    * Easy to extend.
    * Extend everything, add your own validation and output functions.
    * Generated html is valid, the code itself validates in jslint (good parts on except use strict).
    * Uses title attribute for textual errors, can use classes for custom behavior.
    * Works with jQuery 1.3.2 and 1.4
    * Can also be used on single elements outside of forms and inside other (ajax) functions.
